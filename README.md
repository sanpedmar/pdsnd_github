### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project aims to analyze, with a Python script - bikeshare.py -, the bike share usage patterns in three major cities in the United States: 
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington, DC. 
The data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider, covers the first six months of 2017. By computing various descriptive statistics, this project uncovers valuable insights about bike share utilization.

Analysis Objectives
The analysis focuses on four main aspects:

1. Popular Times of Travel - To identify the most frequent travel times, the project examines the start time of bike rides and determines the following:

    - Most common month
    - Most common day of the week
    - Most common hour of the day

2. Popular Stations and Trips - This section analyzes the popularity of different stations and trips by investigating the start and end stations. It provides the following information:

    - Most common start station
    - Most common end station
    - Most frequent combination of start and end stations

3. Trip Duration - The project analyzes the duration of bike trips, providing insights into the total and average travel time.

    - Total travel time
    - Average travel time

4. User Info - This section explores user-related data, including user types and, where available, gender and birth year. It provides the following details:

    - Counts of each user type
    - Counts of each gender (available for NYC and Chicago)
    - Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (available for NYC and Chicago)

The bikeshare.py file is a script that creates an interactive experience in the terminal. It allows users to explore the dataset and obtain answers to specific questions based on their inputs. Users can select the city and time frame for analysis, such as filtering data by month or day. The script handles unexpected input gracefully and prompts users whether they want to see raw data. If chosen, it displays the data in batches of five rows, allowing users to request additional rows or exit.
